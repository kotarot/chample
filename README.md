# Chample

This repository contains a scrambler/solver for Rubik's cube (3x3x3)
based on [Kociemba's Two-Phase Algorithm](http://kociemba.org/math/twophase.htm).
The programs are written in C, which are just converted code
from original Kociemba's java program
([Cube Explorer](http://kociemba.org/download.htm)),
but include some useful options.

## Applications

* [Champler](http://wrcc.main.jp/tools/champler) is a Web interface for Chample.
* [CubeChampleAPI](http://www.terabo.net/cube/apidocs/chample/) is a API for Chample.
